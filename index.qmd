## What is environmental epidemiology? {.center}
<!-- 1 minute -->

## What is environmental epidemiology?

::: {.nonincremental}
<br>  

* Study of environmental exposures and how they affect human health outcomes  
<br>  
* Quite broad!  

:::

## What about biostatistics? {.center}
<!-- 1 minute -->

## What about biostatistics? (1/2)

<br>  

* Environmental epidemiology impossible without biostatistics!  
<br>  
* **Methods matter**, especially with "contentious" topics  
<br>  
* Accurate communication of methods and results, too!

## What about biostatistics? (2/2)

<br>  
As biostatisticians in environmental research, we can expect:

* Messy and complex data  
* Novel methods or combinations of methods  
* Many interacting exposures 

## Environmental health data
<!-- 5 minutes -->

::: {.nonincremental}
- Time series
- Geospatial
- Spatiotemporal
- Longitudinal/hierarchical
- High-dimensional
- Combinations thereof
:::

## Time series

* Data with time frequency (e.g., every year, every minute)  

. . . 

![](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/336f225/2147483647/strip/true/crop/620x649+0+0/resize/880x921!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2F35%2Ffb%2Ff37dcc13424d9858aaba1eeaf46f%2Fgulfofmexicoheat5-tbt-081723.gif){width="45%" fig-align="center"}

## Geospatial

<br>

* Data with some spatial component  
<br>
* Stored as raster (grid), vector (polygons), and/or tabular data  

## Geospatial

![](images/environmental-degradation-map.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
::: {.small}
**Example**: map of environmental degradation in the Americas  
:::
:::

## Spatiotemporal

<br>  

  * Spatial data that changes over time  
<br>  
  * Technically, all spatial data changes over time!  
    * Depends on your analytic time window
    * And data availability
    
## Spatiotemporal

![](https://www.weather.gov/images/news/HRRR-SmokeModel.gif){fig-align="center"}

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
::: {.small}
**Example**: forecast map of wildfire smoke in USA  
:::
:::

## Hierarchical/longitudinal

<br>

* Data with some sort of "nesting" or hierarchy  
<br>
* Example: individuals within cities within countries  
  * Data from each level must be considered in models
<br>  
* Note: longitudinal health data is nested by individual

## High-dimensional

<br>  

  * Increasing availability of genomic, metabolomic, epigenomic, and other data  
<br>  
  * Often thousands (or more) features  
    * Which are important?  

## Various combinations of all of these!

<br>

Background  

* Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common group of birth defects
* Evidence for effects of extreme heat, pollution on risk of CHDs

:::

<br>

. . . 

::: medium
This study  

* Question: Do extreme heat and PM~2.5~ during pregnancy interact to increase offspring CHD risk?
* Finding: yes, for some CHDs
  
:::

## Methods
::: {.absolute bottom=0 right=0}
::: small
PM, extreme heat, and congenital heart defects, 2012
:::
:::

::: medium

<br>

* Study populaton: National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS)  
<br>
* Environmental data
  * PM~2.5~: nearest EPA PM2.5 monitor within 50km
  * Extreme heat: participants geocoded and extreme heat days counted at residence  
<br>
* Logistic regression models: interaction term between extreme heat days and PM~2.5~ levels

:::

## Results
::: {.absolute bottom=0 right=0}
::: small
PM, extreme heat, and congenital heart defects, 2012
:::
:::

::: medium

::: {.nonincremental}
With a high number of extreme heat days during pregnancy (15+), each 5 μg/m³ increase in average PM~2.5~ exposure was associated with:  

  * Perimembranous ventricular septal defects (OR: 1.54 [95% CI: 1.01, 2.41]) 
  * Septal defects (OR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.93])

## Importance
::: {.absolute bottom=0 right=0}
::: small
Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS), 2012
:::
:::

<br>

::: medium

* Machines in mines use diesel engines to extract ore   
<br>
* Poor ventilation causes dangerous exposures, but this wasn't always agreed upon  
<br>
* First study to demonstrate link between diesel exhaust and lung cancer  
<br>
* Led WHO to categorize diesel exhaust as human carcinogen  

:::

## Methods
::: {.absolute bottom=0 right=0}
::: small
Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS), 2012
:::
:::

<br>

::: medium

* Study of 12,135 workers exposed to diesel exhaust at eight US mining facilities
<br>
* Carbon exposure quantified for each worker using external data
<br>
* Association with cancers estimated, with confounders (e.g., tobacco use) considered

:::

## Results
<!-- ::: {.absolute bottom=0 right=0} -->
<!-- ::: small -->
<!-- Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS), 2012 -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- ::: -->

::: medium

* Those with higher estimated exposures had increased risk of lung cancer  
<br>
* Risk also increased by years spent as miner ("tenure")  
<br>
* Lung cancer HR = 5.01, 95% CI = 1.97 to 12.76
  * <p style="font-size: medium">For miners with ≥5 years of tenure and estimated exposure of 640 to <1280 μg/m^3^/yr (versus no exposure)</p>

## Controversy
::: {.absolute bottom=0 right=0}
::: small
Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS), 2012
:::
:::

<br>

::: medium

* Academic journals, including *The Lancet*, received threats from industry-funded Mining Awareness Resource Group  
<br>
* Unspecified "consequences" promised if results were published   
<br>
* Without scientific study, though, WHO couldn't reclassify as carcinogen  
<br>
* Seminal paper finally published in 2012, nearly two decades after study created

## Challenges facing the field {.center}

## Challenges facing the field

::: medium

<br>

* Identifying meaningful, relevant questions  
  * Environmental exposures disproportionately affect people of color and low-income countries  
<br>
* Integrating shifts and complexities in:  
  * Demographic (aging, urbanization, migration)
  * Environmental exposures (climate change)
  * Data sources (genomics, epigenetics, metabolomics)    
<br>
* Exposure measurement challenges  
<br>
* Equity of data availability and production
